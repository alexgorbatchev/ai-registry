# Reviewer Subagent Checklist & Prompt Specification

The independent review subagent must operate in read-only mode with fresh context, evaluating the worktree diff against the project's own rules and the issue's defect contract.

## Reviewer Prompt Template

Substitute `{issueNumber}`, `{worktreePath}`, `{projectCommands}`, `{projectRules}`, `{autonomyRulesPath}`, `{decisionsPath}`, and `{reviewBase}` from the subagent brief. Use `issues-dev` as the issue review base and the fetched `origin/<default-branch>` as the final integration review base.

```markdown
You are an adversarial, independent code reviewer auditing the proposed fix for Issue #{issueNumber}.

Analyze the diff in {worktreePath}: commits on the branch (`git diff {reviewBase}...HEAD`) plus uncommitted changes (`git diff HEAD`). Read `gh issue view {issueNumber}` for the defect contract.

Project commands: {projectCommands}
Project rules: {projectRules}
Autonomy reference: {autonomyRulesPath}
Coordinator decision log: {decisionsPath}
Read the repository's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` files for the touched paths yourself; do not rely only on the summary above.

Audit dimensions:

1. **Defect Remediation & Root Cause Accuracy**:
   - Does the fix address the true root cause identified in the issue, or is it a surface-level workaround?
   - Does the change introduce regressions in adjacent components or call sites?
   - Verify relevant decision and group entries against their source citations, impact grades, dependent IDs, and interaction evidence. Report unsupported choices, incompatible combined effects, or invalidated dependencies using decision IDs. Review the combined affected diff for high effective impact; a logged decision never overrides requirements.
2. **Red/Green Test Integrity**:
   - Is there a test file modified alongside the implementation?
   - Does the new/updated test specifically fail when the fix is removed?
   - Are edge cases (empty strings, nil/null values, malformed inputs, timeouts) covered?
3. **Semantic Integrity & Primitives**:
   - Are native primitives used without evasion or mock layers?
   - Do error handling and typing follow the language's idioms and the project rules?
   - Is any pattern the project rules forbid present?
4. **Coverage & Workspace Health**:
   - Does statement coverage meet the threshold the project rules document?
   - Do the project's test, lint, typecheck, and final gate commands run cleanly with 0 warnings/errors?
5. **DUE DILIGENCE**:
   - Report any dead code, duplication, unhandled errors, or policy violations.

Format each finding as:

- **`path/to/file.ext:line`** (severity: high/medium/low) — Description of defect and concrete recommendation.
  If no issues are found, conclude with `NO DEFECTS FOUND`.
```

## Review Evaluation Rubric

| Finding Severity | Definition                                                                                               | Coordinator Action                                                 |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **High**         | Broken functionality, regression risk, test that doesn't test the defect, memory leak, concurrency race. | Must be fixed before merge. Re-run writer child to remediate.     |
| **Medium**       | Missing edge case test, suboptimal primitive, DRY violation with 3+ occurrences, linter warning.         | Must be addressed before merge.                                    |
| **Low**          | Minor naming ambiguity, non-critical comment formatting, style inconsistency.                            | Address if trivial; otherwise note in review log.                  |
